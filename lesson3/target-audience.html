            The idea behind this website is to attract lucrative business owners 
            to the Everett area. We're hoping that they set up their businesses in the area and join
            the Chamber of Commerce. We're also looking to attact investors. Obviously, there's going to be many 
            small, mom and pop type shops, and we're all about supporting the local community, what better way to support 
            than connect their potential investors to them.
