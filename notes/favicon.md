# Favicon and others
- Go to: favicon.ico 

```html 
<link rel="favicon" href="./...">
```

```css
#herodiv {
    position: relative; 
}
``` 
This is going to make it relative to the container its in. 
Parent container needs to be position relative 
Child is position absolute
This is for overlays btw.
