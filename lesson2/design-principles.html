                Joji's website is a spectacular example of Visual Alignment. What it does best is actually very simple: 
                everything is centered. It's simplistic design conveys the idea that there's not too much more you need to know. 
                From the screenshot you can see album art, which is actually a .gif, and you can see a tour date. Outside of the 
                screenshot there's more tour dates and there's a link to his merchandise. That's it. It's not overwhelming, it's not in your
                face, it's actually the opposite. It's calming. It's a lot like his music actually, which I would note is really 
                great design.

            <p>The Surfaces website is an exemplar of color choice. One look and you can tell
                that they had a clear color palette in mind. In the background you can see several 
                shades of purple and pink that blend together into a sunset, these shades are contrasted 
                by nothing less than the color of the sun. The mountain in the back is a hint of bluegray that 
                goes very well with the lighter shades of purple higher up in the sky. The green on the tree matches
                the bush and the guitarist's shirt very well as well as the water beneath their feet. 
                The hair of the two artists actually matches the sun and their pants the sky. On top of that they 
                have a very interactive design with menu items sliding in as they walk the beach.

            <p>The Nike Website is a great example of following the two thirds rule, 
                and we can see it right off the bat with the first image. The first out of the two images
            is taking up approximately 2/3 of the screen, with the focal points being on the runners. The text follows this rule 
        as well with the bigger text being the one-liner "New moves, best you". </p>
